# User Availability Management System

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to manage their availability slots and for admins to schedule meetings based on those slots. It consists of a React frontend and an Express.js backend, with MongoDB used for data storage.

## System Architecture

- **Frontend**: Developed using React, responsible for user interactions and displaying availability slots.
- **Backend**: Developed using Express.js, responsible for API endpoints and business logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB, used to store user data, availability slots, and scheduled meetings.

## Design Choices

1. **Frontend (React)**:
   - The `UserPanel` component allows users to add, view, and delete their availability slots.
   - The userâ€™s availability is fetched from the backend and displayed in a list.
   - A modal (currently commented out) is used for editing slots.

2. **Backend (Express.js)**:
   - API endpoints are provided for managing availability and scheduling meetings.
   - Middleware is not used for user identification; the `userId` is included directly in the URL.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - **User Schema**:
     ```js
     import mongoose from "mongoose";

     const availabilitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       date: { type: Date, required: true },
       slots: [
         {
           _id: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, auto: true },
           start: { type: Date, required: true },
           end: { type: Date, required: true },
           duration: { type: Number, required: true }, // in minutes
         },
       ],
     });

     const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
       role: { type: String, enum: ["admin", "user"], required: true },
       availability: [availabilitySchema],
       sessions: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Session" }],
     });

     const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
     export default User;
     ```

- **MongoDB**

### Installation

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Download and install Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository


Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Backend Dependencies:

express: Web framework for Node.js
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
cors: Middleware for handling CORS
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file
body-parser: Middleware for parsing request bodies
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Frontend Dependencies:

react: JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Configuration
Backend:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:
bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
PORT=5000
Replace mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database with your MongoDB connection string.
Frontend:

No additional configuration is required for the frontend.
Running the Application
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend API at http://localhost:5000.
